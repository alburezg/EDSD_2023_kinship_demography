## Demographic microsimulation

- Model individual-level demographic behaviour using set of rules
- Manufacture individual-level data
- Simple inputs
- Different alternatives:
   + SOCSIM
   + CAMSIM
   + R/python
   + Agent-based modelling: more tomorrow!

## Demographic microsimulations with SOCSIM

- A stochastic microsimulation platform, 1970s at UC Berkeley
- Starts with initial population
- Each simulated individual experiences specific rates every month (e.g., mortality, fertility, marriage)
- Keeps track of kinship ties to create a full genealogy
- **UC Berkeley SOCSIM User Manual**\footnote{\tiny Mason, C. (2016). SOCSIM Oversimplified. UC Berkeley. https://lab.demog.berkeley.edu/socsim/CurrentDocs/socsimOversimplified.pdf}

## SOCSIM

## Input data for SOCSIM microsimulation

1. User-provided
   1. Initial population
   1. Age-specific fertility rates
   1. Age-specific mortality rates

1. Optional or default parameters available
   1. Marriage transition rates
   1. Model for marriage market
   1. Other transition rates
   1. Other parameters (inheritance of fertility, etc.)

## Pros and cons of SOCSIM microsimulation

**Strengths**

- Keep track of kinship ties
- Full genealogies
- Low data requirements
- Flexible and adaptable states

**Limitations**

- Not real populations
- Correlated input rates
- Computing power

## When to use demographic microsimulations?

- Use real data whenever possible
- Complex inter-generational processes
- Trace ancestry or relatedness
- Improve the interval validity of simulations
   + Calibration
   + Comparing simulations to ground-truth
   + Methodological triangulation

## How to access SOCSIM?

- Unix version UC Berkeley Demography Lab: https://lab.demog.berkeley.edu/socsim/
- **New** Windows version at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research
